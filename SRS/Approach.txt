📌 Required Approach
1. Classification using ML model

Train an ML model (Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest).

Input features → attendance, avg_score, overdue_days, fraction_unpaid, attempts_used.

Output → classify students as At Risk (1) or Safe (0) (or probability of dropout).

This step gives you a data-driven classification.

2. Apply Rules after ML

Once the ML model predicts a student as “At Risk”,

Apply your rule-based engine to:

Explain why (attendance low, scores dropping, fees unpaid, many attempts, etc.).

Assign risk level: 🟢 Green, 🟠 Orange, 🔴 Red.

Basically:

ML = who is risky

Rules = why they are risky

   Dashboard (Flags + Reasons + Notifications)

✅ Example

ML model says: Student A = 1 (At Risk), probability = 78%.

Then rules are applied:

Attendance = 62% (<75%)

Avg score = 35% (<40%)

Fees overdue = 45 days

Final Dashboard shows:

Risk = 🔴 High

Probability = 78%

Reasons: Low attendance, Low scores, Overdue fees.

👉 This way, you satisfy both ML classification (professor’s requirement) + rules for explainability (SIH requirement).

Do you want me to modify the Streamlit prototype so it first classifies with ML and then applies the rules for explanations?
