    "<h2 style=\"color: yellow;\"><span style=\"color: white;\">Description:</span> Attendance percentages live in one spreadsheet, test results in another, and fee-payment data in a third. No single view exists to signal that a learner is slipping in multiple areas simultaneously. Commercial analytics platforms promise predictive insights but demand funds and maintenance beyond the reach of public institutes. A simpler, transparent approach would merge existing spreadsheets,apply clear logic to colour-code risk,and notify mentors on a predictable schedule.Such a system must be easy to configure, require minimal training, and empower educators-not replace their judgment. By focusing on data fusion and timely alerts rather than complex algorithms, the institute can intervene early and reduce drop-out rates without fresh budget lines.</h2>"
